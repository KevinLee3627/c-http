          i tried to keep things as simple as possible. this means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>vanilla HTML, CSS, JS<sup>1</sup></li>
          <li>web server written in C<sup>2</sup></li>
          <li>art drawn in Paint</li>
        </ul>
        <p>which in turn, means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>no dependencies or packages to deal with<sup>3</sup></li>
          <li>no complicated setup to run server<sup>4</sup></li>
          <li>no reliance on external platforms/providers<sup>5</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>and most importantly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a fun project, and</li>
          <li>a good learning experience!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          and that's all there is to it. i mostly wanted to do something different
          instead of reaching for the same tools i've been using forever
          (node + front-end framework).

          <p><sup>1</sup>say it with me: blazingly fast, no dependencies, 2kb gzipped</p>
          <p><sup>2</sup>as my first project in C, it was not as awful as i thought it would be to get a POC up and
            running</p>
          <p><sup>3</sup>almost - the web server needs the libssl-dev package.
            and if you try to tell me about all the other stuff you need to install onto the OS
            i'll just stick my fingers in my ears and go la-la-la until you go away
