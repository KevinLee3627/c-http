# HTTP Server in C
First project in C!

## TODO
- Error checking in parse_request and send_response (invalid request format?)
- SSL Certs?
- Find out what HTTP 1.1 features exist
- Get feedback on code - this is my first c project after all
- Serve HTML on /XXX - if there's no extension, default to .html
